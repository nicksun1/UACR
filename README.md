# Biomarker Analysis

It was proposed that there may be novel information to gain from performing an additional analysis of a new biomarker endpoint not typically performed. Thus this data was manipulated, log-transformed and had a regression analysis run on it to compare the effects of a study drug against both placebo and an active compactor. As a new methodology, the analysis was done for only a couple of studies at a time and then eventually spread to most relevant studies for the particular compound. Combined with each study having many unique elements and the organization structure of different studies for a compound, each study has its own analysis file which can be called by a driver program. 
After determining the usefulness of this particular biomarker regression analysis, it was extended to assessing the majority of studies within the compound and also combined different studies together for a comprehensive look at the compound in question. The biomarker analysis was also extended to a new compound to test its viability on other compounds.
