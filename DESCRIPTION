    Includes multiple studies from the compound trials comparing against active comparators and placebo. Outputs a summary of the regression analysis including 
    means, geometric means, change, percent change, 95% confidence intervals, and relevant standard errors. Additionally includes comprehensive look at compound 
    through lens of new biomaker with various combined analysis'. Also includes a quick look at application towards other compounds. Run through a driver program 
    which calls each program.
